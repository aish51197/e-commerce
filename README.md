# E-commerce 

### You don't need to include any bootstrap or jquery file. I have already add all these.

# Project Structure
* `index.html` - Landing Page
* `css/` - This contains all the css files for each page and following standard requirements:-
	* `bootstrap.min.css` - Bootstrap4 
	* `animate.css` - For animations
	* `font-awesome` - Fontawesome icons
	* `pagename.css` - `pagename` is name of your page and you have to write css for your page in this file.
* `js/` - This contains jquey and any other js file. If you need to create a js file then create one with `pagename.js` and put it into this folder.
* `img` - Image folder. Create new folders like `elctronics` and put all images of this page into this subfolder.
